# Elevens-Solitaire
Solitaire game for iOS
## How to Play
Select two cards whose sum is 11 to remove them from the layout. Cards that are removed will be replaced with cards in the deck. Ace cards have a value of 1 and face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) must be paired with eachother. In *Classic Mode*, the player is timed and the game ends when either all cards on the deck are paired and removed, or there are no more possible moves. The app stores the shortest time to complete as the best time. In *Arcade Mode*, an infinite number of cards will be drawn from the deck and there will always be at least one possible move. The player has 60 seconds to score as many points as possible by creating pairs. Each pair is worth 1 point, but selecting an invalid pair deducts 1 point. The game stores the highest score.
